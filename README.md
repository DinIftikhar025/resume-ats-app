# Job Application Assistant

The **Job Application Assistant** is a web application that helps job seekers optimize their resumes for **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**. The app allows users to upload their resumes, paste a job description, and receive an optimized resume that is tailored to match the job description for ATS compatibility. The tool also provides an ATS score to help assess how well the resume is optimized.

This app is built using **Streamlit**, a Python-based web framework, and leverages natural language processing techniques to optimize resumes for ATS compatibility.

## Features

- **ATS Optimization**: Upload your resume and paste the job description to receive an optimized resume.
- **ATS Score**: Get a percentage score that indicates how well your resume matches the job description, helping you improve your chances of passing the ATS.
- **Resume Upload**: Supports `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt` file formats for resume uploads.
- **Job Description Input**: Paste the job description directly into the app to get a tailored resume.
